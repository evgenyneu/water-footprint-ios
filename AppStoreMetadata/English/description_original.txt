This app shows how many liters of freshwater is needed to produce one kilogram of various agricultural products. For example, one needs about 15 thousand liters or water to make a single kilogram of beef. In comparison, it takes 285 liters or water to make a kilo of potatoes.

Why should I care?
--------------------

Agriculture is responsible for the biggest part of our global freshwater consumption. Three times more water is used in agriculture than in all industries. Furthermore, we use several times more water for irrigation than for all household purposes including drinking, washing, bathing and gardening.

Freshwater used in agriculture comes mainly from three resources: rainwater, surface and groundwater. Those resources are unequally distributed. Some regions of our planet have enough freshwater while other regions experience significant shortages. The world population is growing while consumption of agricultural products is increasing. It is becoming important for us know the water footprint of agricultural products. This information will help us regulate water consumption and sustain our scarce freshwater resources.


How water footprint is calculated?
---------------------------------

The water footprint of a product is the sum of the water footprints of all steps taken to produce it. For example, the water footprint of an animal product consists of different components: the indirect water footprint of the feed and the direct water footprint related to the drinking water and service water consumed. The water footprints of crops and animal products vary across countries and regions. The water footprint shown in this app is the global average.
