# Water Footprint app for iOS

The app shows how much water (in litres) is required to produce a number of agricultural products. For example, to make a kilo of cheese one needs to use about 5 thousand litres of freshwater.

## Help me localizing the app

Currently the app is available in Chinese, English, Japanese and Russian languages. I would be grateful if you can help me translate the app to other languages. Translation includes the list of agricultural products (500 words), the app title, description (400 words) and a couple of words in the UI.
