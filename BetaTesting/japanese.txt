Title: A native Japanese speaker needed to test an iOS app on the iPhone.
---------------------


Hello friends,

I need to find a person for testing a Japanese version of my iOS app. It is a small app with a single screen. My goal is to make sure there are no bugs in the software before releasing it to the public. I estimate the testing job to take up to one hour. When applying just answering the screening questions with "yes" or "no" is enough.


Job deadline
----------------------

The testing needs to be done today, Nov 21st.


Job requirements

I am looking for a native Japanese native speaker that has:

1. An iPhone with iOS version 8 or 9.
2. Apple ID (iTunes account).
3. A Test Flight app installed.


What needs to be tested
----------------------

1. Read the app description to understand what the app is about.
2. Send me your apple ID for registering as a beta tester for this app.
3. Install and launch my app form the Test Flight app.
4. Check if the app shows the list of products.
5. Check if you can search for a product.
6. Check if all app text and numbers are localized for Japanese audience properly.
7. Try using the app in different screen orientations: portrait and landscape.
8. Send me a test report, answering three questions:
  a. Was it easy to look up water footprints for various products?
  b. Was it easy to search for a particular product?
  c. What would you improve in the app?
